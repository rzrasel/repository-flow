00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,600
All right, today we’re unpacking a geopolitical 
mess that’s spicier than a street food stall’s  

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,960
hottest curry. We’re talking about how China’s 
had enough of India’s antics and is tightening the  

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,880
noose around it, with the recent Pahalgam attack 
giving Beijing a golden ticket to speed things up.  

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,240
India’s been acting like the neighborhood bully, 
pushing around smaller countries like Sri Lanka,  

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,000
Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh, but it made 
a fatal error: painting China as its rival in  

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the West’s eyes. Big mistake. China’s been 
quietly playing savior to India’s victims,  

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,760
and now, with Bangladesh’s new leadership 
and some jaw-dropping military moves, India’s  

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,760
cornered itself into a hopeless spot. Stick 
around, because this is about to get wild.

Thanks. Your support truly means the world.
India’s been strutting around South Asia like  

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:37,520
it owns the place, throwing its weight at 
smaller neighbors. Take Sri Lanka: in 2022,  

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,040
when its economy tanked, India offered a $4 
billion aid package, but it came with strings—New  

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,160
Delhi wanted control over key ports and energy 
projects. Sri Lanka, desperate, had to play along,  

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,040
but China swooped in with debt restructuring 
and investments through its Belt and Road  

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,920
Initiative. By 2024, Sri Lanka’s Hambantota 
Port was firmly under Chinese influence,  

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,800
a slap in India’s face. Then there’s Maldives. 
India tried to strong-arm the island nation  

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,240
into prioritizing its military presence, but 
President Mohamed Muizzu, elected in 2023,  

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:28,000
kicked out Indian troops by May 2024 and signed 
defense pacts with China instead. Nepal? Oh,  

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,280
India’s been meddling there forever, but in 2024, 
Kathmandu joined the BRI, cozying up to Beijing  

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:45,200
for infrastructure deals worth $2.5 billion. 
And Bangladesh—here’s where it gets juicy.
 

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,680
When Sheikh Hasina’s government fell in August 
2024, Muhammad Yunus stepped in as interim leader.  

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,200
Unlike Hasina, who often bent to India’s pressure, 
Yunus is all about development and zero tolerance  

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,440
for New Delhi’s bullying. Bangladesh is a 
game-changer because of its location—right next to  

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
India’s vulnerable “Chicken’s Neck,” the Siliguri 
Corridor, a 20-kilometer-wide strip connecting  

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,080
India’s mainland to its northeastern states. 
If that gets cut off, India’s in deep trouble.  

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,160
China’s been pouring money into Bangladesh, 
with $1.4 billion in BRI loans in 2024 alone,  

30
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,160
building roads, ports, and power plants. But 
here’s the kicker: reports from The Hindu  

31
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,560
in April 2025 revealed China’s constructing an 
airbase in Bangladesh’s Rangpur district, just 300  

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,960
kilometers from the Chicken’s Neck. That’s not a 
neighborly gesture; it’s a strategic chokehold.
 

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,360
Now, let’s talk about the Pahalgam attack. On 
April 22, 2025, terrorists struck Baisaran meadow  

34
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,320
in Jammu and Kashmir, killing 26 people, 
mostly tourists. As the days are passing,  

35
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,400
it is getting clearer and this attack is 
looking more like an inside job. New Delhi,  

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,720
led by Narendra Modi, saw this as a chance to 
flex its muscles and rally domestic support  

37
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,320
by playing the anti-Muslim card. Big blunder. 
India banned Pakistani ships from its ports,  

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,280
suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and closed 
the Wagah-Attari border. Modi thought Pakistan  

39
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,360
would back down. Spoiler alert: it 
didn’t. Pakistan’s got China’s backing,  

40
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,640
and China’s not here to play nice.
Let’s zoom out. For the past six months,  

41
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,520
China’s been outmaneuvering India like a chess 
grandmaster. First, there was the bombshell in  

42
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,560
January 2025 when Pakistan and China inked a 
deal for 40 J-35 fifth-generation fighter jets.  

43
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,560
India’s Tejas program, meanwhile, is a 
laughingstock—decades behind. Pakistan’s air  

44
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,800
force, bolstered by Chinese tech, outclasses 
India’s aging Sukhois and even its 36 French  

45
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Rafales. And here’s a cheeky thought: maybe 
France is secretly glad India’s Rafales haven’t  

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:30,240
faced Pakistan’s J-10C yet. No one wants their 
shiny jets embarrassed by Chinese engineering.
 

47
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Then came the news that shook India’s defense 
analysts: Bangladesh’s Rangpur district,  

48
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
already hosting that Chinese airbase, 
reportedly had ISI operatives active,  

49
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,560
according to a report by Hindustan Times. India’s 
intelligence network in Bangladesh is strong,  

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,360
but it’s scrambling. Modi’s hate-mongering 
after Pahalgam backfired spectacularly. Instead  

51
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,760
of isolating Pakistan, it pushed Bangladesh 
closer to China. A retired Bangladeshi general,  

52
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Fazlur Rahman, even suggested that Dhaka should 
team up with China to seize India’s northeastern  

53
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,560
states if India attacks Pakistan, as noted by 
NDTV on May 3, 2025. Bangladesh’s government  

54
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,040
distanced itself, but the message was clear: 
India’s neighbors are done with its attitude.
 

55
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,960
China’s strategy is like a boa constrictor—slow, 
deliberate, and suffocating for India. Through the  

56
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,960
BRI, it’s locked in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, 
and now Bangladesh. The China-Pakistan Economic  

57
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,240
Corridor, valued at $62 billion as of 2024, 
gives Pakistan’s Gwadar Port a direct line to  

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,200
Beijing’s wallet. Gwadar’s not just a port; it’s 
a Chinese fortress in all but name. Do you think  

59
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,000
China will sit idly by if India threatens that 
investment? Not a chance. Beijing’s state media,  

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,880
like Global Times, has been framing Pahalgam as a 
local issue, subtly backing Pakistan’s narrative  

61
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,560
and dismissing India’s claims of cross-border 
terrorism. China’s ambassador to India,  

62
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,600
Xu Feihong, tweeted condolences after 
the attack but avoided naming Pakistan,  

63
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,360
a diplomatic middle finger to New Delhi.
India’s dug itself into a hole. Modi’s  

64
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,000
post-Pahalgam saber-rattling was meant to boost 
his popularity, but it’s trapped him. Pakistan’s  

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,160
not retreating—its military briefed political 
parties, vowing a “robust response” to any Indian  

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,960
“misadventure.” Indian public opinion, whipped 
into a frenzy by Modi’s rhetoric, won’t let him  

67
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,240
back down without losing face. Meanwhile, China’s 
arming Bangladesh, with $500 million in military  

68
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,680
aid to Dhaka in 2024, per DNA India. India’s 
northeastern states are a powder keg, and the  

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Siliguri Corridor’s never looked more fragile.
Think of India as a guy who picked a fight at a  

70
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,400
bar, only to realize the bouncer’s got 
friends—big, scary friends. Sri Lanka,  

71
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,440
Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh are slipping 
into China’s orbit. Pakistan’s air force is  

72
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,280
ready to make India’s Rafales look like paper 
planes. And that Chinese airbase in Rangpur?  

73
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,960
It’s like Beijing parked a tank in India’s 
backyard. India thought it could play the  

74
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,320
victim card with Pahalgam, but all it did was hand 
China a megaphone to amplify its influence.
 

75
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,960
What’s next? India’s running out of 
moves. Its economy’s shaky—growth slowed,  

76
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,440
while China’s BRI pumps billions into its 
neighbors. Modi’s domestic posturing can’t  

77
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,320
hide the fact that India’s surrounded. In the next 
few months, expect more Chinese military deals,  

78
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,280
maybe even a naval base in the Maldives, as DNA 
India speculated. India’s intelligence might try  

79
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,600
to stir trouble in Bangladesh, but with Yunus in 
charge and China watching, that’s a long shot.  

80
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:24,400
The Pahalgam drama didn’t just expose India’s 
weaknesses; it accelerated its downfall.
 

81
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,520
So, there you have it—India’s geopolitical 
blunders laid bare. China’s playing the long game,  

82
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,960
and India’s helping it win. If you enjoyed
