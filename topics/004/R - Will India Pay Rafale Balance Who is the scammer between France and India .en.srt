1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
I wonder how the 10-day national

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,960
celebration in the Bed Empire is going.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,559
Whether the people fully feel the joy of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,800
victory and the greatness of Modi since

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,560
India crushed Pakistan in the border

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,880
conflict and France's Rafael fighter

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,960
jets enhanced by AI technology

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,800
outperformed Chinese equipment.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,920
Shouldn't India with such great military

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,640
achievements pay the remaining balance

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
for the Raphael jets? The French have

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
repeatedly complained about India's

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
delayed payments. Now that India has won

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
the war, sending parliamentarians

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,120
everywhere to proclaim victory and God

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,559
media releasing numerous videos accusing

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,559
global media of ignoring India's

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,559
achievements. Well, we acknowledge India

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
crushed

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,079
Pakistan. So, the French are waiting for

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,120
the

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,199
payment. Yes, when doing business with

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,160
Indians, one rule must be remembered.

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,000
Full payment must be made before

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,479
shipment. Otherwise, once the goods

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,360
arrive in India, it's hard to say when

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,040
or if you'll receive the remaining

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,880
payment. Chambers of commerce in China's

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
Guang Dong and Ju Jang regions

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
constantly remind companies to be

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,520
cautious when shipping to India. This is

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,119
a hard lesson learned by Chinese

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,479
businesses after years of being

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,720
deceived. At the Canton Fair, Indian

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,799
clients requesting free samples or

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,080
asking merchants to provide lunch are

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,320
outright rejected. Yes, you wouldn't

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,920
believe it, but some Indians deceive

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
Chinese merchants into discussing

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
projects just to get a free lunch and

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,360
then disappear. For these anecdotes, you

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
can check my previous videos which

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,720
explain them in detail. In short,

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,640
Chinese businesses no longer invest in

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,960
factories in India to avoid being

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,920
targeted by the Indian government. Nor

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,439
do they ship goods before receiving

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,520
payment. Most Chinese manufacturers

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,920
require Indian clients to pay the full

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,640
amount or about 80% of the payment

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
before shipping. But in the information

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,680
age, do the French not know about

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,479
India's business reputation? Of course

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,720
not. The French are not selling weapons

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
to India for the first time and are well

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,239
aware of the Indian government's

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,239
international reputation. The French are

58
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,480
smart. They bribe Indian officials and

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,280
sell Raphael jets to India at three

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,080
times the price of an

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,280
F-35. Even if India pays only 30% of the

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,440
deposit, the French won't lose money. As

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,160
for the remaining balance, they'll

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,040
recover whatever they can. After the

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,040
IndiaPakistan air conflict broke out,

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,120
global media confirmed through various

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,360
channels that a Raphael jet was shot

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,360
down by

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,840
AJ10. Only Indian media insisted that

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,360
India achieved victory. A crushing one

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,280
at that. Originally, Dassau was worried

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
that the Indian government would default

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
and refuse to pay the remaining balance

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,400
for the Raphael Jets. Now, the

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
opportunity has come. The Indian

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
government and media for the sake of

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,680
vanity are heavily boasting about their

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,800
achievements and praising the Raphael's

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,519
excellent performance. As a result,

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,159
India has no reason to refuse or delay

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
paying the remaining

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,360
balance. In fact, India media's fake

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,519
news is only for self-entertainment.

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,879
The Indian Air Force's poor combat

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,159
capability has become a global

86
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,959
laughingstock. Mocked relentlessly by

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,440
netizens worldwide just like their space

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,840
docking which lacks video or image

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,920
evidence. They announced success under

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
global skepticism and claim to have

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,280
joined the space docking club. Yes,

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,239
India is obsessed with joining various

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,879
clubs such as the superpower club,

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,760
military power club, technology power

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:58,280
club, 5G leader club and AI technology

96
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,959
club. Honestly, Chinese people are quite

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,640
frustrated. We hope India removes China

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
from the member lists when promoting

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,959
these clubs as we don't want to be in

100
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,920
the same club as a boastful nation like

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,640
India. If there were a beggar club, the

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
Baret Empire would undoubtedly qualify

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,519
as it has half of the world's extremely

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,600
poor population. If there were a clown

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,320
club, the Baret Empire would surely be a

106
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,040
VIP as Modi and the BJP are undoubtedly

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,600
clown kings. If there were a fake news

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,000
club, India's Pocky Sharma would

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
definitely be the club queen with her

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
countless fake news reports.

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Now is the time for India to uphold its

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,479
national reputation under the scrutiny

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,560
of global media, hurry up and pay the

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,680
remaining balance for the Raphael jets

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,840
and continue increasing procurement. Not

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,800
only should the air force equip more,

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,240
but the Navy should also buy in large

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,199
quantities, doubling the procurement to

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,919
ensure crushing Pakistan's J10 jets and

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,520
the upcoming J35 jets in the next

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,360
conflict.

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,479
By the way, you should know that

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Pakistan is certain to equip China's J35

124
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,720
jets, which are fifth generation fighter

125
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,280
jets. At that time, China is likely to

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,120
equip them with PL17 or even PL21

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,039
missiles. When you use Raphael jets to

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
intercept these missiles, you can

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,440
deplete Pakistan's military budget

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,000
further as these new missiles are top

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,960
tier equipment of the Chinese Air Force,

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
far more expensive than the PL-15.

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
You don't need to keep working on your

134
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,840
fifth generation AMCA jet on PowerPoint.

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,919
Nor should you beg the US to sell F35

136
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,120
jets because Pocky Sharma said Raphael

137
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,919
jets have AI combat capabilities, can

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,720
automatically lock onto enemy targets,

139
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,280
and strike intelligently. In the face of

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Raphael jets and the Bed Empire's

141
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:02,520
powerful AI combat capabilities, J10,

142
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,840
J35, PL-15, and PL17 are

143
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,919
insignificant. However, next time you

144
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,840
need to do better propaganda to make

145
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,720
people from other countries believe your

146
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,720
news instead of mocking you

147
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,919
relentlessly. After the next conflict, I

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,240
hope the Bard Empire holds a month-long

149
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:24,160
celebration, preferably broadcast

150
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
globally, so we can share the joy.
