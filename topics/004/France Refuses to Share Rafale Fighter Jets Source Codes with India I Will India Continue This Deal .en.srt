00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
Just one day before the IndiaPakistan

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,879
war on May 6th, India reportedly made an

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,760
official request to France to provide

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,360
the source code for the Rafale fighter

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,480
jets. This was documented in an article

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,359
published on india.com dated May 6th.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,199
However, France declined India's request

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,680
stating it would not share the Rafale's

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,000
source code. Following this, as you're

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,320
aware, during the night of May 7th and

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,039
8th, India launched missile attacks on

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,720
nine Pakistani positions. These strikes

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
were carried out using the very same

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,880
French Rafale jets armed with scalp

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,600
cruise missiles and hammer precisiong

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
guided munitions. But on that same night

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
while operating within its own

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,320
territory, India reportedly lost six

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,039
fighter jets to Pakistani action. These

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,120
included three French Rafal jets, one

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,079
Sue30 MKI, one Mig 29 and one Mirage

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,840
2000. This shocking development occurred

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,399
despite the Rafal being among the most

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
advanced jets in India's inventory.

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
After the conflict ended and a ceasefire

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,199
was established, India once again

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
requested the Rafal source code from

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,119
France. This time applying more

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
diplomatic pressure. However, France

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
once again refused to provide the source

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,760
code. So friends, let's analyze what

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
this source code actually is, why it's

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,759
so important, and how not having it may

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
have affected the Indian Rafaels during

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,159
the conflict. We will also look into the

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
challenges India is now facing and

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,920
whether the recent crash of three Rafals

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
could be linked to this lack of source

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
code access. Moreover, what impact will

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,600
this have on India's recent deal to

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,159
acquire 26 Rafalem naval variant

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,159
aircraft from France? Make sure to watch

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
the video till the end as the upcoming

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
analysis will be deeply informative and

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
help you understand the critical

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
implications of these developments.

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Friends, many of you watch the videos

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,640
without subscribing. Please make sure to

create neutral and fact-based videos on

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
defense and

52
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,280
geopolitics. I present news articles as

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,960
proof to support my content. So, please

subscribe and like this

55
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,920
video. Welcome back. The source code is

56
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,560
essentially the brain of any modern

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,239
combat aircraft. It controls critical

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
software systems such as radar

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,160
integration, weapons targeting, data

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
fusion and electronic warfare

61
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,360
capabilities. Without access to this

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
code, India cannot independently

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
integrate indigenous weapons or modify

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
system functionalities. It will have to

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,400
depend on French cooperation for any

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
such upgrades or adjustments. Friends, I

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
believe now you have a clear

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,640
understanding of what a source code is.

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
Now let's talk about why it's so

70
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,239
important. What loss India suffered due

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,440
to its absence and what advantage

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,840
Pakistan may have gained. You see any

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,040
modern military today whether it's the

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,879
Navy, Air Force or Army operates within

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,760
a networkcentric warfare framework

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,480
during times of conflict. For example,

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,560
the United States uses data link 16

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,959
which enables real-time exchange of data

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,599
between aircraft, naval ships, ground

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,760
forces, and command centers.

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,280
One major advantage the US has is that

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
most of its military equipment is

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,080
indigenously produced. Whether it's

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,400
fighter jets, naval vessels, or awax

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
aircraft, they are all integrated into a

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,760
centralized system and continuously

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
share realtime data with each other

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,800
during combat operations. As I mentioned

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,560
in one of my previous videos, Pakistan

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,680
also has a data link system known as

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,840
data link 17. Through this system,

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
Pakistan's three military branches,

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,720
Army, Navy, and Air Force are able to

94
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,799
share realtime data seamlessly. For

95
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,519
example, consider the incident where a

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,879
Pakistani J10C, while staying within its

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
own territory, shot down an Indian

98
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,159
Rafale. This was possible due to

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
efficient data sharing and coordination.

100
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,879
The J10C is a light to mediumweight

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,519
fighter jet and according to estimates,

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,480
its radar has a maximum range of around

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,200
180 km. The Rafale was reportedly shot

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,840
down using a PL17 missile which has a

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,680
range of 185 km. So how was this

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,760
possible? It was because Awax aircraft

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,439
flying behind the front line had already

108
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,480
locked onto the enemy aircraft and

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,880
shared that targeting data with the

110
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,880
J10C. Once the J10C fired the missile,

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,280
those same Awax aircraft helped guide

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
the missile to its target. This entire

113
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,880
operation illustrates what we call the

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,600
ABC system. Locked by A, launched by B,

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
guided by C. This integrated combat

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,919
system effectively links groundbased

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
radars, airborne early warning aircraft

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,240
and fighter jets into one cohesive unit.

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,840
A hallmark of true network ccentric

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,240
warfare. Currently, India operates four

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
different data links whereas ideally a

122
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
country should have just one unified

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,320
data link system. The first is the air

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,400
force network followed by the integrated

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
air command and control system which

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
enables real-time coordination between

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,440
aircraft surfaceto-air missile systems

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,000
and ground control units. Then comes

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,520
data link 2 which facilitates secure

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
communication between Indian navy

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,759
warships and Indian air force aircraft.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
The fourth is the thales link used in

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
Rafale fighter jets. However, this Thaly

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
system is not integrated with India's

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,880
other systems because France has not

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
provided the source code for it. As a

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
result, whenever India operates Rafale

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
fighters, they cannot fully integrate

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,400
with groundbased air defense systems. To

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
avoid friendly fire or interference,

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,479
either these air defense systems must be

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
turned off or the Rafals must fly away

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,120
from areas covered by groundbased

144
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
defense units. Moreover, Rafale jets

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
cannot share data with India's existing

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,919
Awax platforms either. As I've mentioned

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
before, India already has a limited

148
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,919
number of Awaxs and Rafale's radar has a

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
maximum range of around 200

150
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,080
km. The jet Spectra electronic warfare

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,080
suite also has a limited range of about

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,479
100 to 150 km. In contrast, Pakistan's

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,280
Awax and EW aircraft offer coverage of

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,199
up to 500 km and are fully integrated

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,280
under a single system. Data Link 17. All

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
of Pakistan's defense equipment operates

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,680
within this unified data network.

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,360
Additionally, China has provided

159
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Pakistan with the source code for the

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,160
J10C fighter jet, allowing it to be

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,120
fully integrated with Pakistan's Awax

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
and EW platforms. This integration

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,080
provides Pakistan with a significant

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,440
advantage in networkcentric warfare

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,440
capabilities. Just like India has a

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
large number of Russian-made equipment

167
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
which does not integrate well with

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,199
Western systems because Russian gear is

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
fundamentally different from Western

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,319
technology. Pakistan's military benefits

171
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
from Chinese equipment that is more

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,800
compatible with Western systems. For

173
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
example, Pakistan's airborne early

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,440
warning and control aircraft include the

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,120
Swedish Saab 2000 and their Chinese

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,479
systems are designed similarly to

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,560
Western ones making integration easier.

178
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,800
Pakistan has successfully integrated its

179
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,440
F-16s Mirage 3 and 5, JF17 Thunder and

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,039
J10C aircraft under a single data link

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,880
system link 17. Meanwhile, India

182
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,800
currently operates four separate data

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
links and is developing a fifth one

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,360
called B-Net through DRDO aiming to

185
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,360
unify its network ccentric capabilities.

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
France through Desalt Aviation, the

187
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
manufacturer of Rafal has argued that it

188
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,360
cannot share the source code due to

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,599
concerns over intellectual property and

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,440
proprietary defense technology.

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
According to French officials, the

192
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
development of the Rafal platform

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,280
involved years of intensive research in

194
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,960
substantial financial investment.

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
Sharing the code could jeopardize its

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
strategic advantage and defense export

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
market. While this argument may seem

198
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,599
technically valid, many Indian defense

199
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
analysts and political commentators are

200
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
viewing it as a diplomatic betrayal,

201
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
especially given the premium price India

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,440
paid for the jets and the portrayal of

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,440
France as a trusted defense

204
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,840
partner. The refusal puts a dent in

205
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,800
India's vision of strategic military

206
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
autonomy. If India needs to integrate

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
specific missiles or electronic warfare

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,000
suites during a crisis, it will now

209
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
require French approval and technical

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,120
involvement. This goes against the ethos

211
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,160
of the

212
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,479
atmirerbarat, self-reliant India

213
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,759
campaign, which emphasizes building and

214
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
controlling indigenous defense

215
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,720
capabilities. The Rafal deal has always

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,199
been a political flash point. When the

217
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
deal was signed in 2016, several

218
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,120
opposition parties, particularly the

219
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,519
Congress, raised concerns about inflated

220
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
prices and lack of transparency. With

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
France now declining to share critical

222
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,159
technological control, those earlier

223
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,080
objections appear to carry renewed

224
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,160
weight. India now faces two choices.

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,560
either renegotiate with France for

226
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
limited or monitored access to essential

227
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
parts of the source code or double down

228
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
on the development of indigenous

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,040
platforms like the TEDES MK2 or the

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,160
upcoming AMCA advanced medium combat

231
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,160
aircraft. Long-term strategic

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,560
independence lies in boosting domestic

233
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,440
R&D and ensuring future contracts

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,360
safeguard technological sovereignty. I

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
hope friends that you have understood

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
well. I have tried to explain it in very

237
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,399
simple words. Please do share your

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,880
valuable opinions in the comments.

239
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,640
That's all for today's update. Please
