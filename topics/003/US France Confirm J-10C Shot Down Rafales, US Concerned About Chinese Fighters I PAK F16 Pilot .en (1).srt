1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Friends, today's video is going to be

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,960
very important as we'll be discussing

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,120
three major news. First, when Indian

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,800
foreign secretary Vikram Misri was asked

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
about the Indian fighter jets being

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,320
destroyed by Pakistan, here's what he

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
had to say. Second, what are US and

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
French officials saying regarding the

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,039
Indian fighter jets that were reportedly

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
shot down by Pakistan? And friends, US

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,560
officials are also becoming concerned

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,679
that Chinese equipment is outperforming

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,199
Western equipment. And third, India is

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,480
also claiming that it has shot down

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,200
Pakistan's F-16s in Rajasthan and has

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,360
even captured a pilot. And most

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,440
importantly, what is the US vice

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,120
president saying about the IndiaPakistan

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,239
conflict? This video is going to be very

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,480
interesting. Friends, whatever I say,

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,160
I'll back it up with proof. If you think

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm lying, feel free to DM me on

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,800
Instagram with the evidence and I will

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
definitely correct my mistake. Friends,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,680
many of you watch the videos without

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,199
subscribing. Please make sure to

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,120
subscribe. I put in a lot of effort to

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,199
create neutral and fact-based videos on

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
defense and

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,840
geopolitics. I present news articles as

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,799
proof to support my content. So, please

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,720
subscribe and like this video. It has

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
now been over 30 hours since the second

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,680
attack on Pakistan by India, which was a

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,759
drone strike. Yesterday when I made a

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
video I mentioned that Pakistan was

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,840
claiming to have intercepted 29 Israeli

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
made Harop loitering munitions launched

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
from India and they even presented

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
visual evidence as proof. At that time

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
Indian officials meaning the Indian

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,640
government and military leadership were

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,799
not accepting this claim. However, today

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,439
has confirmed that yes, India did carry

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
out drone attacks on Pakistan because

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,840
Pakistan had earlier conducted drone

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,799
strikes in Indian Punjab. So according

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
to him, this was a retaliatory strike.

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,040
However, Pakistani officials have

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,280
rejected this statement. Friends, in

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
this ongoing IndiaPakistan conflict,

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
finding the real news has become

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
extremely difficult. It usually takes

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
about 12 hours after any development for

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
the actual facts to emerge and it

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,920
requires a lot of research. Now India is

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,239
claiming that it intercepted Pakistani

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
drones in Indian Punjab. But so far I

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,200
haven't come across any proof. No drone

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,680
parts, no visuals, nothing has surfaced.

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
If anyone has proof, please DM me on

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,959
Instagram. Now let's talk about the

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
Indian foreign secretary's press

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,760
conference. During the press conference,

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,599
a journalist asked him, "Pakistan is

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,959
claiming to have shot down five Indian

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,040
fighter jets. What is your response? Did

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,519
Pakistan actually destroy five Indian

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,840
jets or not? Please give a yes or no

71
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,680
answer to this." Mr. Vikram Misri

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,239
responded that no comments will be made

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
on this matter for now. He said that the

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
answer will be given at the appropriate

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
time regarding whether Indian fighter

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,760
jets were shot down or not. You can

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,560
listen to his statement yourself to hear

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,560
exactly what he said.

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
So friends, from the statement of the

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,640
Indian foreign secretary, it seems clear

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,319
that he doesn't want to lie because if

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
Indian fighter jets had not been shot

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,400
down, he would have outright said so.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
His silence suggests that jets were

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
indeed shot down. Look, no country's

86
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,959
foreign minister or foreign secretary

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,599
can lie openly because these officials

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
represent their country at the United

89
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,400
Nations. So, I believe that my Indian

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
friends now have their proof that

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
fighter jets were indeed downed. Now,

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
let's move to the second news story,

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360
which comes from a BBC article, an

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,280
outlet that to some extent is even

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
considered pro-India.

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
They reported that they have found

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,000
evidence of the wreckage of a Rafal

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,959
fighter jet. According to BBC verify, in

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,479
one clip geoloccated by BBC verify to a

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,440
field near the city of Bethinda in

101
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,120
India's Punjab state, troops can be seen

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
collecting debris from what experts

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,840
suggest was a crashed jet. We have also

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
located two further clips from the same

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,479
location filmed at night. One shows

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
debris in the field, while another shows

107
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,199
a projectile catching fire in the sky

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
and then fire in an open field.

109
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,560
Justin Crump, a former British Army

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,199
officer who now runs the risk

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
intelligence company, Cibilene, told BBC

112
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,199
Verify that the wreckage appears to be

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,759
from a French air-to-air missile of the

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000
type used on both Mirage 2000 and Rafale

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,160
jets, both of which are operated by the

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,160
Indian Air Force. Another image

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,240
circulating on social media shows a tail

118
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,160
fin marked with BS001 and Rafale on it.

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,919
A Google reverse image search reveals

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,280
that this image is not from any older

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,440
incident. It appears to be new and

122
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,520
genuine. Friends, remember one thing.

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
These days, even if people lie a lot,

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
it's also easier to uncover the truth.

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,800
You can now verify whether images are

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,320
fake or real. And the wreckage verified

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
by BBC is from Bethinda in Indian

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,919
Punjab. This news, which was published

129
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
by Reuters, concerns the downing of

130
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,960
three fighter jets in Jamu and Kashmir.

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,639
Following this, French intelligence

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,639
officials revealed in an interview with

133
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,520
CNN that there is confirmation of one

134
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,360
Rafal jet being shot down by Pakistan.

135
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
While investigations are still ongoing

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
regarding Pakistan's claim of three jets

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,240
being downed, you can read the article

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,919
for details. The New York Times has

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,880
reported that the Indian Air Force has

140
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,720
suffered heavy losses. In addition, US

141
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,960
military officials in an interview with

142
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
Reuters stated that it is confirmed that

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,759
Chinese-made fighter jets shot down two

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
Indian aircraft. The US is closely

145
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
monitoring this development, especially

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,039
as Chinese equipment appears to be

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,360
outperforming Western systems in this

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,840
incident. Here is a quote from US

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
officials. The performance of a leading

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,520
Chinese fighter jet against a western

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
rival is being closely watched in

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
Washington for insights into how Beijing

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
might fare in any potential conflict

154
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,160
over Taiwan or in the broader

155
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
Indo-Pacific region. One US official

156
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,919
speaking on condition of anonymity said

157
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,560
there is high confidence that Pakistan

158
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,319
used Chinese-made J10 aircraft to launch

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
air-to-air missiles against Indian

160
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,280
fighter jets, bringing down at least

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
two. Another official added that one of

162
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,680
the Indian jets that was shot down was a

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
French-made Rafale fighter aircraft.

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,639
Both officials confirmed that Pakistan

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,680
did not use its US supplied F-16 jets

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,280
manufactured by Loheed Martin in the

167
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,520
shootown. Meanwhile, India is claiming

168
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,080
that it has shot down a Pakistani F-16

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,400
and captured the pilot. But let's keep

170
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,560
one thing in mind. Pakistan is not

171
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
allowed to use its F-16s outside of its

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
own territory. This restriction is part

173
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
of the agreement between Pakistan and

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
the United States when the F-16s were

175
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,160
sold. According to that deal, Pakistan

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,759
can only operate F-16s within its own

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,840
airspace. So the claim that a Pakistani

178
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
F-16 was shot down inside Indian

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
territory, specifically in Rajasthan,

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,599
does not hold up under scrutiny. It's

181
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,160
highly unlikely and probably incorrect.

182
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,680
Friends, that was the analysis. Make

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
sure to share your thoughts in the

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
comments because friends, in today's era

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
of social media, it doesn't take long

186
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
for proof, visuals or evidence to come

187
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,599
out. If India has truly captured the

188
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,560
pilot of a Pakistani F-16, then they

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,919
should present him to the world as

190
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,319
proof. Anyway, the real developments

191
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,240
related to this will surface soon.

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
Similarly, if Pakistan has actually

193
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
carried out drone attacks in Jammu and

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Kashmir, then evidence of that will also

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,440
come to light in due time. That's all

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,000
