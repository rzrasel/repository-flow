1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,120
imagine that you were born in India the

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,120
seventh biggest country in the world and

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,359
the most spiritual country in the world

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,679
the land known for its diverse cultures

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,040
and enchanting Landscapes you wake up in

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,080
the morning stand up from your bed and

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,120
open the window and the first thing you

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,000
notice is a huge mountain of trash which

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,279
is so high that it has warning lights on

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,240
top of it to prevent aircraft and

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,920
helicopters from crashing inad stepping

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,000
out outside the first thing you see is

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,199
extra crowded streets filled with street

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,119
food prepared with a lot of oil and

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
spices the smell of which makes you feel

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
dizzy after a few minutes you notice

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
that it's hard to breathe and you start

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,879
coughing like a chain smoker even if you

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,399
haven't smoked a cigarette in your

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,920
entire life in no time you understand

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
the cause of your sickness which is all

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
around you that that and that is typical

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,120
India and it really really

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,039
sucks so let's start from the beginning

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,920
the first place you're going to visit is

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,199
the Mount Everest of trash also named

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,519
gazipur l fill tons of trash are

28
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,440
transported daily from different parts

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
of the city to this landfill which was

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
initially designed as a temporary

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
solution to India's waste problem

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,759
however the problem wasn't solved and

33
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,479
with time it only got bigger today the

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,680
gazipur landfill has grown to be bigger

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,880
than 40 soccer fields and taller than

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
the Taj Mahal which is around 2113 ft

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,119
tall every year a few times the

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,000
landfills Catch Fire and destroy the

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,119
houses nearby because of the burned

40
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,240
plastic and other chemicals the smell

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,399
becomes unsupportable especially in the

42
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,240
high heat the pollutant produced from

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,840
burning intoxicates the water and soil

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
which fever has a huge impact on the

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,320
Local's

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,520
Health despite the fact that India has a

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,920
terrible environment even Indians are

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,040
afraid to marry women from gazipur

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,759
because it's believed that no women

50
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,479
older than 16 can carry a healthy child

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,880
under such conditions it is practically

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,280
impossible to prevent such fires because

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,320
no fire truck can reach the top of the

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
mountain so the firefighters only

55
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,679
extinguish the most available Parts

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,479
usually the base of the mountain with

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
the highest Parts being unreachable when

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,160
there's no fire scavengers make their

59
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,360
way through the piles of trash these

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,480
people make their living by collecting

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,680
recyclable materials and manually

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
selecting plastic from trash making a

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
few dollars a day which helps them not

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,360
die of

65
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
hunger

66
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,160
because of the terrible ecology a lot of

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,519
people suffer from various diseases that

68
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,680
mutilate their bodies and take away

69
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,530
their chance to live a normal

70
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,599
[Music]

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,440
life all right but why not just leave

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,040
and go to a much more livable City the

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,280
short answer is that some people just

74
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,239
can't afford it a lot of the them were

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,319
already born into poverty like their

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,560
neighbors whose only source of existence

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,519
is separating plastic from trash others

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
just don't care accepting this type of

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
existence as normal yes Indians accept a

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
lot of things as normal that would be

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
unacceptable in any other Society for

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
example the open statistics say that

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,840
close to 594 million people which is 48%

84
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
of the population in India practice open

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
defecation that's half of the population

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,640
dumping over 65 million kilos of poo in

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,239
the streets Fields or Rivers every

88
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,879
single day even though in 2015 the

89
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,760
Indian government built half a million

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,720
home toilets a lot of people still

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,000
prefer to fertilize the soil outside

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
helping to spread a ton of diseases

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
through water and air that phenomenon

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,599
confused the sanitary inspectors who

95
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,599
decided to investigate household toilet

96
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,159
usage very quickly they discovered that

97
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,400
most of the toilets were used as storage

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,439
rooms that's because many Indians

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,400
believed that having a toilet inside the

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,560
house was absolutely unhygienic however

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,840
open defecation isn't the only practice

102
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,720
used by Indians to make their country

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
uninhabitable another usual thing is

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
spitting caused by this thing called pan

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,319
Masala which is an Indian traditional

106
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,480
chewing mixture usually consisting of

107
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,040
spices mixed with bittl nuts and slate

108
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,199
lime when consumed it's supposed to

109
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,280
provide a sense of relief after meals

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,759
serving as a mouth freshener however

111
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,040
Indians mix it with tobacco which has a

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,000
terrible effect on health increasing the

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
risk of oral cancer among many others

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,560
chewing pan Masala produces a lot of

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,280
saliva which has a black brownish color

116
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
eventually you could see a lot of people

117
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,160
spitting like camels directly on the

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,360
streets and even in public transport

119
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,160
leaving everywhere disgusting Brown

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
puddles reminding you of blood all right

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
let's say that we got tired of people

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
who defecate and speit on the streets

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
and we decided to change the atmosphere

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
and relocate to the cultural center of

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
India Delhi with the hope that it should

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,560
be better there at least the streets

127
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
should be cleaner and people more

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,919
cultural finally you're in Delhi but

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,960
once you arrive it becomes clear that

130
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,240
you haven't reached your destination yet

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,199
yes here in Delhi the government puts

132
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,840
more effort into preventing Street

133
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,320
pollution by installing trash bins but

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
that doesn't really work because people

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,280
steal them and sell them a scrap metal

136
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,039
for a few pennies you'll not be

137
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,960
surprised to learn that Delhi is also

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,720
the city with the highest level of air

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,759
pollution in the world the scientist

140
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,639
concluded that spending a single day

141
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,560
outside in these conditions is like

142
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,080
smoking 50 cigarettes on this highway

143
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,360
located near Delhi the smoke was so

144
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,199
dense that drivers couldn't even see

145
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,440
where they were going as a result more

146
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,759
than 25 cars were involved in a massive

147
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,360
accident on this 3D air pollution map we

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
can check the air quality worldwide in

149
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,880
real time blue and green colors mean

150
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
that the air quality in this region is

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
good yellow means that the air quality

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,160
is moderate orange and red mean that the

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
air quality is unhealthy and purple

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
means that the air quality is very

155
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,280
unhealthy and even hazardous now if we

156
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,160
take a look at the United States we

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
notice that the color is blue and green

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,599
if we jump to Europe we can see that the

159
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,680
color is mostly green which means that

160
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
in this region the air quality is pretty

161
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,319
good but let's now take a look at India

162
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,960
here we can see that the color has

163
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
changed to orange red and the air index

164
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
pollution is 20 times higher than the

165
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,440
norm which means that any contact with

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,960
outdoor air should be avoided at all

167
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,039
another problem is Indian Street food

168
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,039
and the sellers who ignore any hygiene

169
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,919
or safety Norms whatsoever

170
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,800
there are countless videos where Street

171
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,919
vendors prepare the food with bare hands

172
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,199
and in the same oil and that's not the

173
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,319
worst you get diarrhea and you get

174
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,800
diarrhea and you get diarrhea everyone's

175
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
getting diarrhea this ignorance in

176
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,039
combination with the street pollution

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,560
could leave you at high risk of getting

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
sick from germs or bacteria nearly

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
poisoned because of a traffic exhaust

180
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,960
fumes and on the ede of desperation you

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
decide to move to one of the oldest

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,479
cities in the world where people are

183
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
much more humble and haven't forgotten

184
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,039
about God the spiritual capital of India

185
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,440
theany still on the way you sense a

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,240
smell so unpleasant that it couldn't

187
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,919
even be compared with the smell from

188
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,280
gazipur however you still can't figure

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,639
out what it is but shortly after it

190
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,680
becomes clear that this is a combination

191
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
of FAL hashish and burning corpses you

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
see veran SE besides being the spiritual

193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,479
capital of India is also famous for its

194
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,800
River the gangas which is the dirtiest

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
river in the world on the banks of the

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,160
gas bodies have been cremated for

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
hundreds of years that's because Hindus

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,599
believe in the cycle of birth death and

199
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,840
rebirth so the act of cremation is seen

200
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
as releasing the soul from the body so

201
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,520
that it can continue its journey in the

202
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,000
afterlife or be reincarnated that's why

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
tens of thousands of bodies are cremated

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,080
there every single year and the ashes

205
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,319
are lowered into water but because of

206
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,639
poverty not every Indian has a necessary

207
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,039
firewood to entirely burn the body

208
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,400
therefore dozens of half bured bodies

209
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
flow on the river crowding together and

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,199
rotting until recovered by volunteers

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,080
who often need to even dive into the

212
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,159
water the bodies that couldn't have been

213
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,560
recovered wash ashore were there usually

214
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,240
eaten by hungry dogs or crows however it

215
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
is prohibited to burn pregnant women and

216
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
children under 13 these people are

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
instead died to a stone and drown in the

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
GES not too long ago the wife should

219
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
have been burned along with her husband

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,400
after he passed away this tradition was

221
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,560
known as Sati and was declared illegal

222
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,960
only 90 years ago even though there are

223
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,759
thousands of dead bodies drowned in the

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,240
GES River every single month a lot of

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
people are comfortable washing in the

226
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,440
river and even drinking directly from it

227
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,039
because of filthy conditions and

228
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,000
people's indifference diseases that

229
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
civilized society has forgotten about

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,360
for hundreds of years can still be found

231
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,959
here for example leprosy also known as

232
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
Hansen's Disease which is considered

233
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,160
eliminated in most European countries

234
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,040
still exists in India with 120,000

235
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
people suffering from it every single

236
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,360
year yes you could say that not all

237
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,399
Indians are like that there are actually

238
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,360
normal people who would really love to

239
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,519
make a change but let's make a guess

240
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,480
right now what country do you think this

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
location is in the signs are written in

242
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,480
Hindi so it should be India right wrong

243
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,640
that's a street called Little India in

244
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,320
one of the cleanest countries in the

245
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,760
world Singapore in Singapore it's

246
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
illegal to spit in coffee shops or

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
markets but it's also illegal on public

248
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,720
roads sideways and any other place

249
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,680
that's open to the public if you break

250
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,399
this law you'll be slept with a fine of

251
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,040
up to $1,000 what about littering

252
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,000
firsttime offenders face a fine of up to

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,120
$1,000 Singapore dollars repeat

254
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,079
offenders will be fined up to2 2,000

255
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,800
Singapore dollars and subject to

256
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,839
corrective work order but even that

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,720
doesn't help when there are problems

258
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
with the environment and comfort of the

259
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
city people often point the finger at

260
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
the government however that's not the

261
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
case with India where the fish rots from

262
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
the tail down and it all begins with

263
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,800
people's mentality you see from ancient

264
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,000
times in India there was a cast system

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
established the highest casts are the

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,880
ones who litter and the lowest are the

267
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,000
ones who clean however the amount of

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
trash produced by multiplying this logic

269
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
by billions of people would be too much

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
for even an army of cleaners to handle

271
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
although Indians are known for keeping

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,040
their homes and bodies clean they're

273
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,800
indifferent to what happens over their

274
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,079
fence another problem is that before

275
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
Indians joined the global food system

276
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,440
all waste was environmental either

277
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,000
decomposed naturally was burned or the

278
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,399
leftovers were eaten by cows this is

279
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,120
where the habit of throwing everything

280
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,640
under food came from with the ition of

281
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,160
plastic Glass and Metal people still

282
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
have the tendency to throw everything

283
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,600
under food but now cows can't eat it and

284
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,120
it doesn't decompose the last reason is

285
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,240
the passive propaganda even if the

286
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
country occasionally airs advertisements

287
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,079
on federal channels warning of the

288
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,240
dangers associated with waste this is

289
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,600
completely insufficient in today's world

290
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,800
on paper the maximum fine for throwing

291
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
trash on the street is $6 but in

292
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,440
practice no one is taking it seriously

293
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,839
even Indians don't know it exists so I

294
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,800
didn't any fines when you lit it no

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,200
there are no fines here you can just

296
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
throw it anywhere nobody gives two shits

297
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
about it India is a perfect example of

298
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
the broken windows Theory which states

299
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
that visible signs of disorder and

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
misbehavior in an environment encourage

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,519
further disorder and misbehavior leading

302
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,959
to Serious crimes where simply put if

303
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
one window is broken and isn't repaired

304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
soon more windows will be broken in the

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
neighborhood because people would stop

306
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
being civilized if their environment

307
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,000
isn't and we see such an example in

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,240
India where the more garbage is thrown

309
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,160
on the streets the more garbage will be

310
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,440
thrown my words can be confirmed by an

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,480
experiment which was made in India

312
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,800
volunteers found a dirty Street cleaned

313
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,839
it up and painted the walls and it

314
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,360
helped people stopped littering there

315
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
they did the same thing with a dirty

316
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,200
Store Wall transforming it into a public

317
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,240
toilet and it helped as well people

318
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,399
stopped being on the wall what about the

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
smog pollution if we take a look on this

320
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,880
graph we can notice that in October and

321
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
November the level of air pollution

322
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,240
increases hundreds of times but car are

323
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
driving all year round and factories

324
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
don't go on vacation so what's the

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,240
matter the thing is the majority of

326
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,480
smoke does not appear in the city it's

327
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,839
coming from Punjab and harana which are

328
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,800
two main agricultural regions in the

329
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,920
country rice is grown here which

330
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,720
requires a huge amount of water for

331
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,040
irrigation and at some point so much

332
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,160
water was required that there was a risk

333
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,519
of serious environmental consequences

334
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,399
therefore the authorities passed a law

335
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
According to which it is forbidden to

336
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
plant rise before the start of the rainy

337
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,040
season which starts in August so the

338
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,680
Harvest period has shifted to the

339
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,959
beginning of October and because of this

340
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,839
the farmer has less time to prepare for

341
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,959
the new season so in order to clean the

342
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,360
fields faster they simply began to burn

343
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,480
them every year burning fields are

344
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
producing a huge Cloud which is blown

345
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,360
directly into Delhi by the winds and

346
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,959
mixed with exhaust fumes and

347
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,160
construction dust recently they tried to

348
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,040
bend the burning of the fields but the

349
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,320
law was not accepted we could say that

350
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,199
everything we talked about in this video

351
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,360
is the concern of politicians on the

352
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
other hand if the Indians don't want to

353
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
make a change the politics wouldn't take

354
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,399
any action until something Clicks in the

355
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
minds of the entire half a billion

356
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,120
people nothing will change or perhaps as

357
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
soate
