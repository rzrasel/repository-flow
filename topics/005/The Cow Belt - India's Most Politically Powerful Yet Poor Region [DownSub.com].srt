1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,359
India's most politically powerful and

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
populous region is also its most

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
backward and you know nobody wants to

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,759
talk about it. This part of India has

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,519
the most voters, the most members of

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,519
parliament and the most influence on who

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,359
becomes prime minister. It's called the

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,520
cow belt. But don't let the name fool

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
you. Behind the holy cows and the temple

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
bells, this region is drowning in

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
poverty, violence, illiteracy, religious

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
extremism, and political manipulation.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
And it's dragging the rest of the

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,200
country down with it. Let's get straight

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
into it. The cowbelt is a stretch of

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,840
northern India that includes U Pradesh,

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
Bihar, Madya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jarand,

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
Chhattisgar, and parts of Harana and

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
Udarakand. These states form the

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,480
Hindspeaking heartland of India where

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
the cow is considered sacred and Hindu

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,440
nationalism is thriving. It's the BJP's

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
fortress, Narendra Modi's comfort zone

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
and it's also where democracy goes to

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
die a slow painful death along with

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
basic manners, hygiene and many other

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,040
things. Let's start with some numbers. U

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
Pradesh alone sends 80 MPs to

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520
parliament. That's more than the entire

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
south of India combined. Add Bihar's 40

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,119
MPs, Madya Pradesh's 29, Rajasthan's 25,

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,280
and the rest of the cow belt, and you're

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
looking at a political juggernaut.

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
Whoever wins the cowbell basically wins

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
India. There's a reason why Modi and the

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
BJP keep education levels low in this

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
area so that they can ply them with

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
misinformation and brainwash

39
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,000
them. Now, here's the problem. This

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
region holds massive power, but it's in

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
complete shambles. Let's talk about

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
poverty. According to the latest

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
multi-dimensional poverty index, Utar

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
Pradesh, Bihar, Jarand and Madya Pradesh

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
are among the poorest states in India.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
In Bihar, over half the population lives

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,079
in poverty. These are people who don't

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,000
have access to clean water, working

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,079
toilets, basic health care or decent

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
housing. In 2023, a report showed that

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,680
three out of every 10 children in these

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
states are malnourished. In some

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
it's even worse. Now education the

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,319
literacy rates in these states are

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
embarrassingly low. Bihar's literacy

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
rate is around 63% compared to 94% in

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,319
Kerala. Utar Pradesh isn't doing much

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,040
better hovering around 73% which might

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
sound okay until you remember that this

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
is basic literacy just the ability to

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
read and write your name. When it comes

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
to actual education quality most

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
government schools in these states are

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
underfunded, understaffed and

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
practically falling apart. The annual

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
status of education report has been

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
sounding the alarm for years. In rural

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
UP, for instance, more than 50% of

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
children in grade 5 can't even read a

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,920
second grade level

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,280
text. Now, let's talk about health.

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
Maternal mortality, infant mortality,

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
and access to health care are all worse

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,319
in the cow belt. In U Pradesh, the

76
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
maternal mortality rate is over 200

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
deaths per 100,000 live births, double

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
the national average. Hospitals lack

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
basic equipment. Doctors are in short

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,519
supply. And in many villages,

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,000
superstition still replaces science.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
What about jobs? Youth unemployment is

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
rampant. A 2022 report found that Bihar

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
and Utar Pradesh had some of the highest

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
youth unemployment rates in India. Even

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
those with degrees, many of them from

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
shady private colleges, end up driving

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
rick shaws or working as daily wage

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
laborers. In Bihar, during one of the

90
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
government job exams, millions of people

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,640
applied for just a few thousand

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
vacancies. Some PhD holders applied for

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
low-level jobs. That's how desperate

94
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
things

95
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,560
are. And here's where it gets even more

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
twisted. Despite all of this, despite

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,760
the poverty, the illiteracy, the

98
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,879
hopelessness, the people here keep

99
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
voting for the same parties, especially

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
the BJP. Mod's face is everywhere. Yogi

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Adityanath, a hardline monk turned

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,799
politician, is the chief minister of

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
Udar Pradesh and is openly pushing a

104
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
Hindutva agenda. The BJP doesn't win

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,959
here in spite of the misery. It wins

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
because of it. Here's how it works. When

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,280
people are poor, uneducated, and

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
desperate, it's easier to distract them

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,599
with religious nationalism. Instead of

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,160
jobs, you give them riots. Instead of

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
development, you give them temples.

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
Instead of questioning power, they're

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
told to protect the cow. Cow politics is

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
no joke here. Cow slaughter is banned in

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
most cowbelt states and Muslims, dolls

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
and Christians have been lynched on mere

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
suspicion of transporting beef. These

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
lynch mobs often walk free. Sometimes

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
they're even celebrated. Remember

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Pukhan, Aklak, Tabresari, their names

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
should haunt us. But here they're

122
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
brushed aside as necessary sacrifices

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
for a Hindu raashtra. And the media,

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
don't even get me started. Most of the

125
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
national Hindi language media outlets

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
are based in Delhi or Noa, right next to

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
the cow belt. and they've become

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,639
full-time cheerleaders for the ruling

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,120
party. Watch a Hindi news channel for 5

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
minutes and you'll see anchors foaming

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
at the mouth about Pakistan love jihad

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
or how Modi is saving Parat. You won't

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,680
hear a word about hunger or

134
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,039
unemployment. A message to Paly Sharma

135
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
and the God media. You are actively

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
making your country worse by blindly

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,240
cheering Modi and the BJP's terrible

138
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,600
policies. But why is this region so

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
backward in the first place? Let's go

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
back in history. The gangetic plains of

141
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,000
the cow belt were once the cradle of

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Indian civilization. Ancient cities like

143
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,759
Veronasi, Patna and Aayodia were centers

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
of learning, culture and commerce. In

145
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
fact, it was one of the wealthiest

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,000
places in the world during the ancient

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
and early medieval periods. But over

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,479
time, especially during colonial rule

149
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
and after independence, investment

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
shifted elsewhere toward coastal states

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,639
and Carnitaka. The cowbelt was left

153
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,280
behind. Postindependence cast politics

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
became the dominant force here. Leaders

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
like Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar and

156
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
Mayawadi in Udar Pradesh rose by

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
mobilizing lowercast votes. These were

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
important movements for social justice,

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
but they didn't always lead to good

160
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
governance. In fact, corruption,

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
nepotism, and criminalization of

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,960
politics became widespread. Then came

163
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
the BJP with a new formula. Combine

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
upper cast consolidation, Hindu

165
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,080
nationalism, and cow worship, and you

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
get a winning machine. This is not just

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
about religion, it's about controlling

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
people. When you convince the majority

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
that they're under threat from

170
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,039
minorities, you don't have to answer any

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
real questions. Why do you think Modi

172
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
rarely does unscripted interviews and so

173
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,479
the cowbell becomes a factory of

174
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,680
majoritarianism? Freedom of speech is a

175
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
joke. Disscent is punished. Journalists

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
who ask tough questions are jailed,

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
beaten, or worse. Activists disappear.

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,880
Even comedians aren't safe. Ask Munawar

179
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,560
Farooqi. But the irony is the people

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
suffering the most are the very ones who

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
keep the BJP in power. They don't have

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
clean drinking water. They don't have

183
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
decent jobs, but they have WhatsApp,

184
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
Twitter, and other social media

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
platforms where every problem is blamed

186
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,599
on Muslims, liberals, China, or the

187
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
West. We've all seen the angry netzens

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,479
flooding the comment sections. Let's be

189
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
real. This is not just about the BJP.

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,199
The Congress, regional parties, and the

191
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
entire political system have failed this

192
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
region again and again. But the BJP has

193
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
perfected the art of weaponizing that

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
failure. Take Uttar Pradesh again. This

195
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
is a state that sends the most MPs to

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
parliament. It's home to the Ganga to

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
Aayodia to Varanasi Mod's own

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,599
constituency and yet it ranks near the

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,160
bottom in every human development index.

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
In some parts of the state, especially

201
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,560
in Bundelkand and eastern UP, conditions

202
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
are so bad that families sell their

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
daughters into marriage just to survive.

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
And it's not just a rural problem. Even

205
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
urban areas like Kpur, Patna, and Bopal

206
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,280
are struggling with broken

207
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,639
infrastructure, terrible pollution, and

208
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,960
rising crime. Remember the investor

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,879
summit in Bopal where the lunch hall was

210
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
stormed and destroyed by hundreds of

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
attendees just because there was some

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
free curry and samosas. Meanwhile, Yogi

213
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
Aditanath is building the Ram Mandir.

214
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,720
Modi is unveiling statues. The media is

215
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
clapping. And the people, they're still

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
waiting for a better life. Compare this

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
to southern states like Kerala or Tamil

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Nadu. Yes, they have their own issues,

219
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
but their literacy rates, health

220
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
indicators, and social welfare systems

221
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,840
are miles ahead. In fact, the south

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
often subsidizes the cow belt through

223
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
central taxation but gets insulted for

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,240
being too westernized or

225
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,760
anti-Hindu. Speak Hindi, not Tamil, they

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
say while receiving Tamil

227
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,399
taxes. So the hard truth which many

228
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
nisens don't want to hear is that the

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,959
cow belt is holding India back not just

230
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
economically but socially and

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
politically. It's a place where

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
democracy is being replaced by

233
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,760
demagoguery, where blind faith is

234
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
rewarded and critical thinking is

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
punished. And unless we fix it, the rest

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
of India will be dragged down too. This

237
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
isn't about looking down on poor people.

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,600
It's about demanding better for them.

239
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
They deserve jobs, schools, hospitals,

240
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,720
not just cow statues and hate speeches.

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,959
But for that to happen, we have to stop

242
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
glorifying this region as the soul of

243
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
India. Because right now, it's not the

244
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,240
soul, it's the rot. If you enjoyed this
