imagine that you were born in India the seventh biggest country in the world and the most spiritual country in the world the land known for its diverse cultures and enchanting Landscapes you wake up in the morning stand up from your bed and open the window and the first thing you notice is a huge mountain of trash which is so high that it has warning lights on top of it to prevent aircraft and helicopters from crashing inad stepping out outside the first thing you see is extra crowded streets filled with street food prepared with a lot of oil and spices the smell of which makes you feel dizzy after a few minutes you notice that it's hard to breathe and you start coughing like a chain smoker even if you haven't smoked a cigarette in your entire life in no time you understand the cause of your sickness which is all around you that that and that is typical India and it really really sucks so let's start from the beginning the first place you're going to visit is the Mount Everest of trash also named gazipur l fill tons of trash are transported daily from different parts of the city to this landfill which was initially designed as a temporary solution to India's waste problem however the problem wasn't solved and with time it only got bigger today the gazipur landfill has grown to be bigger than 40 soccer fields and taller than the Taj Mahal which is around 2113 ft tall every year a few times the landfills Catch Fire and destroy the houses nearby because of the burned plastic and other chemicals the smell becomes unsupportable especially in the high heat the pollutant produced from burning intoxicates the water and soil which fever has a huge impact on the Local's Health despite the fact that India has a terrible environment even Indians are afraid to marry women from gazipur because it's believed that no women older than 16 can carry a healthy child under such conditions it is practically impossible to prevent such fires because no fire truck can reach the top of the mountain so the firefighters only extinguish the most available Parts usually the base of the mountain with the highest Parts being unreachable when there's no fire scavengers make their way through the piles of trash these people make their living by collecting recyclable materials and manually selecting plastic from trash making a few dollars a day which helps them not die of hunger because of the terrible ecology a lot of people suffer from various diseases that mutilate their bodies and take away their chance to live a normal [Music] life all right but why not just leave and go to a much more livable City the short answer is that some people just can't afford it a lot of the them were already born into poverty like their neighbors whose only source of existence is separating plastic from trash others just don't care accepting this type of existence as normal yes Indians accept a lot of things as normal that would be unacceptable in any other Society for example the open statistics say that close to 594 million people which is 48% of the population in India practice open defecation that's half of the population dumping over 65 million kilos of poo in the streets Fields or Rivers every single day even though in 2015 the Indian government built half a million home toilets a lot of people still prefer to fertilize the soil outside helping to spread a ton of diseases through water and air that phenomenon confused the sanitary inspectors who decided to investigate household toilet usage very quickly they discovered that most of the toilets were used as storage rooms that's because many Indians believed that having a toilet inside the house was absolutely unhygienic however open defecation isn't the only practice used by Indians to make their country uninhabitable another usual thing is spitting caused by this thing called pan Masala which is an Indian traditional chewing mixture usually consisting of spices mixed with bittl nuts and slate lime when consumed it's supposed to provide a sense of relief after meals serving as a mouth freshener however Indians mix it with tobacco which has a terrible effect on health increasing the risk of oral cancer among many others chewing pan Masala produces a lot of saliva which has a black brownish color eventually you could see a lot of people spitting like camels directly on the streets and even in public transport leaving everywhere disgusting Brown puddles reminding you of blood all right let's say that we got tired of people who defecate and speit on the streets and we decided to change the atmosphere and relocate to the cultural center of India Delhi with the hope that it should be better there at least the streets should be cleaner and people more cultural finally you're in Delhi but once you arrive it becomes clear that you haven't reached your destination yet yes here in Delhi the government puts more effort into preventing Street pollution by installing trash bins but that doesn't really work because people steal them and sell them a scrap metal for a few pennies you'll not be surprised to learn that Delhi is also the city with the highest level of air pollution in the world the scientist concluded that spending a single day outside in these conditions is like smoking 50 cigarettes on this highway located near Delhi the smoke was so dense that drivers couldn't even see where they were going as a result more than 25 cars were involved in a massive accident on this 3D air pollution map we can check the air quality worldwide in real time blue and green colors mean that the air quality in this region is good yellow means that the air quality is moderate orange and red mean that the air quality is unhealthy and purple means that the air quality is very unhealthy and even hazardous now if we take a look at the United States we notice that the color is blue and green if we jump to Europe we can see that the color is mostly green which means that in this region the air quality is pretty good but let's now take a look at India here we can see that the color has changed to orange red and the air index pollution is 20 times higher than the norm which means that any contact with outdoor air should be avoided at all another problem is Indian Street food and the sellers who ignore any hygiene or safety Norms whatsoever there are countless videos where Street vendors prepare the food with bare hands and in the same oil and that's not the worst you get diarrhea and you get diarrhea and you get diarrhea everyone's getting diarrhea this ignorance in combination with the street pollution could leave you at high risk of getting sick from germs or bacteria nearly poisoned because of a traffic exhaust fumes and on the ede of desperation you decide to move to one of the oldest cities in the world where people are much more humble and haven't forgotten about God the spiritual capital of India theany still on the way you sense a smell so unpleasant that it couldn't even be compared with the smell from gazipur however you still can't figure out what it is but shortly after it becomes clear that this is a combination of FAL hashish and burning corpses you see veran SE besides being the spiritual capital of India is also famous for its River the gangas which is the dirtiest river in the world on the banks of the gas bodies have been cremated for hundreds of years that's because Hindus believe in the cycle of birth death and rebirth so the act of cremation is seen as releasing the soul from the body so that it can continue its journey in the afterlife or be reincarnated that's why tens of thousands of bodies are cremated there every single year and the ashes are lowered into water but because of poverty not every Indian has a necessary firewood to entirely burn the body therefore dozens of half bured bodies flow on the river crowding together and rotting until recovered by volunteers who often need to even dive into the water the bodies that couldn't have been recovered wash ashore were there usually eaten by hungry dogs or crows however it is prohibited to burn pregnant women and children under 13 these people are instead died to a stone and drown in the GES not too long ago the wife should have been burned along with her husband after he passed away this tradition was known as Sati and was declared illegal only 90 years ago even though there are thousands of dead bodies drowned in the GES River every single month a lot of people are comfortable washing in the river and even drinking directly from it because of filthy conditions and people's indifference diseases that civilized society has forgotten about for hundreds of years can still be found here for example leprosy also known as Hansen's Disease which is considered eliminated in most European countries still exists in India with 120,000 people suffering from it every single year yes you could say that not all Indians are like that there are actually normal people who would really love to make a change but let's make a guess right now what country do you think this location is in the signs are written in Hindi so it should be India right wrong that's a street called Little India in one of the cleanest countries in the world Singapore in Singapore it's illegal to spit in coffee shops or markets but it's also illegal on public roads sideways and any other place that's open to the public if you break this law you'll be slept with a fine of up to $1,000 what about littering firsttime offenders face a fine of up to $1,000 Singapore dollars repeat offenders will be fined up to2 2,000 Singapore dollars and subject to corrective work order but even that doesn't help when there are problems with the environment and comfort of the city people often point the finger at the government however that's not the case with India where the fish rots from the tail down and it all begins with people's mentality you see from ancient times in India there was a cast system established the highest casts are the ones who litter and the lowest are the ones who clean however the amount of trash produced by multiplying this logic by billions of people would be too much for even an army of cleaners to handle although Indians are known for keeping their homes and bodies clean they're indifferent to what happens over their fence another problem is that before Indians joined the global food system all waste was environmental either decomposed naturally was burned or the leftovers were eaten by cows this is where the habit of throwing everything under food came from with the ition of plastic Glass and Metal people still have the tendency to throw everything under food but now cows can't eat it and it doesn't decompose the last reason is the passive propaganda even if the country occasionally airs advertisements on federal channels warning of the dangers associated with waste this is completely insufficient in today's world on paper the maximum fine for throwing trash on the street is $6 but in practice no one is taking it seriously even Indians don't know it exists so I didn't any fines when you lit it no there are no fines here you can just throw it anywhere nobody gives two shits about it India is a perfect example of the broken windows Theory which states that visible signs of disorder and misbehavior in an environment encourage further disorder and misbehavior leading to Serious crimes where simply put if one window is broken and isn't repaired soon more windows will be broken in the neighborhood because people would stop being civilized if their environment isn't and we see such an example in India where the more garbage is thrown on the streets the more garbage will be thrown my words can be confirmed by an experiment which was made in India volunteers found a dirty Street cleaned it up and painted the walls and it helped people stopped littering there they did the same thing with a dirty Store Wall transforming it into a public toilet and it helped as well people stopped being on the wall what about the smog pollution if we take a look on this graph we can notice that in October and November the level of air pollution increases hundreds of times but car are driving all year round and factories don't go on vacation so what's the matter the thing is the majority of smoke does not appear in the city it's coming from Punjab and harana which are two main agricultural regions in the country rice is grown here which requires a huge amount of water for irrigation and at some point so much water was required that there was a risk of serious environmental consequences therefore the authorities passed a law According to which it is forbidden to plant rise before the start of the rainy season which starts in August so the Harvest period has shifted to the beginning of October and because of this the farmer has less time to prepare for the new season so in order to clean the fields faster they simply began to burn them every year burning fields are producing a huge Cloud which is blown directly into Delhi by the winds and mixed with exhaust fumes and construction dust recently they tried to bend the burning of the fields but the law was not accepted we could say that everything we talked about in this video is the concern of politicians on the other hand if the Indians don't want to make a change the politics wouldn't take any action until something Clicks in the minds of the entire half a billion people nothing will change or perhaps as soate
